## Task Management (Issues Pages)

Task tracking is handled through [GitHub Issues pages](https://github.com/SGF-Codefi-2022/todo-app/issues). This provides us with a forum style view of tasks where we can keep notes and leave feedback on task issues.

You can find the [GitHub issues documentation here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).

It is always good to keep detailed notes in the task issue page while you are actively working. This helps you organize your thoughts and gives you a plan for solving the issue. Then when you re-visit the task after a long weekend you have a record to refresh your progress.

Feel free to add your own issue feature ideas. We can log them now and come back to them later.

If you don't already have any assigned issues look for any open unassigned ones you may be interested in and assign it to yourself to claim it.

One useful feature of issues pages is linking of other issues using hash tags `#`, users with `@`, and commits by pasting the full SHA ID. Github can even detect messages in pull requests such as 'Closes issue #10' which would automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

## Pull Requests

Never commit directly to the `master` / `main` branch. The master branch should always remain stable.

Active developmeent should be committed to your own personal branch. You can then assign yourself issues and begin work on them under your personal development branch.

When an issue is complete push your branch to the origin remote and mark the issue as closed. You can even copy the full commit SHA hash and paste it in the comment box when closing the branch to link the two together.

After you have pushed your personal branch changes to the origin remote you will see a message in Github Desktop or the GitHub web interface suggesting to create a pull request from the pushed branch.

Go ahead and create the pull request adding any comments needed for the reviewer.

Be sure to actively check for open pull requests. If you find any open review them and; if there are no issues; merge them.

## GitHub Markdown

Markdown is another "markup" language like HTML (Hyper-Text-Markup-Language). It is designed to be better for writing using common symbols as syntax delimiters instead of bracketed tags like HTML.

You can even use HTML tags within markup.<br>
Most commonly the `<br>` tag (like this example) is used to force soft newline breaks since markdown will only render hardbreaks normally.
